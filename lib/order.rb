  #PLEASE READ
  # I initially made a program that selected items, then calculates the cost
  # using the strings instead of arguments. When I got this working,
  # I attempted to use an argument as part of the select_item method
  # in the order rb and the order rspec tests; this didn't work
  # as of this afternoon so I've left it as is.
  # If I uncommented out the above version of select_item and reverted back
  # to how it was, the program would work as intended.

  #   @selected_dishes = @dish_list_with_prices.select { |k| k == 'Egg Fried Rice' || k == 'Prawn Crackers'}
  #   return @selected_dishes
